Data visualizations are an incredibly powerful way for journalists and reporters to convey information and news. This month in Visual Dimensions, we will bring in [Michael Keller](https://twitter.com/mhkeller), an interactive multimedia reporter at Al Jazeera America, to talk about the power of data visualizations in Journalism, the burgeoning role of hybrid data visualization developers/reporters, how to make compelling visualizations within a news reporter's short time frame, and why he contributes open source tools for the greater data visualization community. Michael will also be giving us a demo of some of his most compelling data visualizations he has created for Al Jazeera America.
