It was great having [Jeremy Sherlick](http://www.cfr.org/experts/world/jeremy-sherlick/b12974) join us to discuss content strategy for interactive experiences on the web. The talented CFR team creates Emmy award-winning interactive presentations, which educate the public about global news and analyses. Brandon and Jeremy discussed how CFR develops their engaging content strategies for their educational interactive presentations.
