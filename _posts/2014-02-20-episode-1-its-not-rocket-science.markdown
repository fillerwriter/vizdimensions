It was so great to kick off our first Visual Dimensions episode with <a href="https://twitter.com/rsimmon">Rob Simmon</a>, art director of NASA’s Earth Observatory! Brandon and Rob discussed use of color in visualizations as well as visual mapping strategies.  We had a slight glitch with the Q&A during recording, but you can find the questions that were asked and Rob’s answers here:

**Q:** The mariner 4 images look like craypas (aka pastels) what was the actual affect being used there?

**A:** Colored pastels (Rembrandt) Check out <a href="http://directedplay.com/first_tv_image_of_mars.html">http://directedplay.com/first_tv_image_of_mars.html</a> & <a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA14033">http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA14033</a>.

**Q:** How would you choose colors for contrasting categoric variables?

**A:** I have written about this here: <a href="http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/blogs/elegantfigures/2013/08/12/subtleties-of-color-part-3-of-6/">http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/blogs/elegantfigures/2013/08/12/subtleties-of-color-part-3-of-6/</a>
 under the "categorical data" subhead.

**Q:** So we've covered scales. How do you go about choosing a contrasting qualitative scale?

**A:** Check out: <a href="http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/blogs/elegantfigures/2013/08/12/subtleties-of-color-part-3-of-6/">http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/blogs/elegantfigures/2013/08/12/subtleties-of-color-part-3-of-6/</a>

Here are some cool additional data visualization resources:

- <a href="http://helpmeviz.com/">HelpMeViz</a>: HelpMeViz is community of people working together to critique and improve each other's data visualizations.
- <a href="http://thumbsupviz.com/">Thumbs Up Viz</a>: This site is a showcase of interesting implementations of maps and data visualizations.
- <a href="http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/">NASA Earth Observatory</a>: The Earth Observatory showcases many different maps taken as a part of the research happening at the Goddard Space Flight Center.

Look out for next month’s vodcast, where we will be exploring content strategy for educational interactives with <a href="http://www.cfr.org/">Council On Foreign Relations</a> and we’ll get an exclusive tour of their interactive publishing tool, with <a href="https://twitter.com/jeremysherlick">Jeremy Sherlick</a>, Deputy Director of Multimedia at Council On Foreign Relations.
